# 📊 Excelerate Learning Path Analysis

Analyzing learner onboarding data to uncover funnel bottlenecks, wait-time delays, and dropout patterns impacting learner retention and completion rates.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project investigates how learners progress through the Excelerate onboarding funnel — from application to program completion.

Despite receiving **8,500+ applications**, only a small percentage of learners successfully complete their journey.  
This analysis focuses on identifying structural inefficiencies such as:

- Onboarding delays  
- Allocation-to-start wait times  
- Engagement gaps  
- Program dropout patterns  

The goal is to generate actionable insights that improve learner activation and retention by optimizing onboarding workflows.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

- How do learners move through the Excelerate funnel?
- What impact do onboarding delays have on completion rates?
- Why do allocated learners fail to start programs?
- Are Courses or Internships more effective in learner engagement?
- How does waiting time affect learner success probability?

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 📉 8,500+ Applicants, But Very Few Finishes
- 8,558 learners applied successfully
- Nearly 50% never started onboarding
- Only 29 learners completed programs
- Recruitment pipeline is strong — onboarding is the bottleneck

---

### ⏳ Learners Are Stuck in Allocation Phase
- 3,276 learners allocated to teams
- Only 767 actually started
- 80% of "Active" users are waiting for onboarding
- Process delay — not learner dropout

---

### 🎓 Courses Perform Better Than Internships
- Internships have highest enrollment
- 78% of internship learners show no engagement
- Course participants stay active longer
- Course tracks drive higher completion rates

---

### 🕒 Waiting Time Drives Dropout
- Time between application and start is strongest success predictor
- Learners waiting 300+ days almost never finish
- Longer onboarding delays reduce learner motivation
- Faster activation increases completion probability

---

## 📌 Conclusion

- Recruitment strategy is effective  
- Onboarding pipeline is inefficient  
- Engagement depends on activation speed  
- Process delays — not learner intent — drive dropout  

The key challenge lies in reducing onboarding wait time rather than increasing application volume.

---

## 🚀 Recommendations

- Automate onboarding for allocated learners  
- Activate new learners immediately  
- Reallocate budget from internships to course tracks  
- Redefine "Active Users" to reflect true engagement
